# Puppet classes for deploying Hadoop

## Intro

BigTop is now using Puppet 3.x (BIGTOP-1047)!

Installing and starting hadoop services is non-trivial, and for this reason bigtop 

packages puppet instrumentation for the various ecosystem components, which works

synergistically with bigtop produced software packages.

The puppet classes for bigtop deployment setup and deploy hadoop services.

This includes tasks such as:

- service installation
- pointing slaves to masters (i.e. regionservers, nodemanagers to their respective master)
- starting the services

The mode of puppet is masterless : there is no fancy coordination happening behind the scenes.

Puppet has a notion of a configuration directory, called config.  

When running puppet apply, note that puppet's confdir is *underneath* the --confdir value.

For example: 

If you have site.csv in /etc/puppet/config, 

Then you should use --confdir=/etc/puppet , and puppet finds the config dir underneath.

As an end to end example, you can follow the vagrant-puppet-vm recipes to see how to set up

a puppet managed bigtop hadoop installation.  Those examples are gauranteed to work and 

serve as a pedagogical round trip to the way bigtop integrates packaging, deployment, and 

testing all into one package.

## Debugging

If in any case, you need to debug these recipes, you can add notify("...") statements into 
the puppet scripts.  

In time, we will add more logging and debugging to these recipes.  Feel free to submit 

a patch for this !

## Configuration

As above, we defined a confdir (i.e. /etc/puppet/) which has a config/ directory in it.

The heart of puppet is the manifests file.  This file ( manifests/init.pp ) 

expects configuration to live in hiera as specified by $confdir/hiera.yaml. An example
hiera.yaml as well as hiera configuration yaml files are provided with the bigtop classes. They
basically take the form:

<pre>
key: value
</pre>

with syntactic variations for hashes and arrays. Please consult the excellent puppet and hiera
documentation for details.

All configuration is done via such key value assignments in hierdata/site.yaml.  Any options
not defined there will revert to a default value defined in hieradata/cluster.yaml, with the
following exceptions (which are required):

* bigtop::hadoop\_head\_node: must be set to the FQDN of the name node of your
	cluster (which will also become its job tracker and gateway)

* bigtop::bigtop\_yumrepo\_uri: uri of a repository containing packages for
	hadoop as built by Bigtop.

$confdir is the directory that puppet will look into for its configuration.  On most systems, 
this will be either /etc/puppet/ or /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/.  You may override this value by 
specifying --confdir=path/to/config/dir on the puppet command line.

cluster.yaml also serves as an example what parameters can be set and how they usually interact
between modules.

You can instruct the recipes to install ssh-keys for user hdfs to enable passwordless login
across the cluster. This is for test purposes only, so by default the option is turned off.

Files such as ssh-keys are imported from the master using the puppet:/// URL scheme. For this
to work, fileserver has to be enabled on the puppet master, the files module enabled and access
allowed in auth.conf. fileserver.conf should therefore contain e.g.:

<pre>
[files]
  path /etc/puppet/files
  allow *
</pre>

No changes are required to the default puppet 3 auth.conf.

For other options that may be set here, look for class parameters in the modules'
manifests/init.pp files. Any class parameter can be used as a hiera key if prefixed with the
module and class namespace. Module hue's server class will look for its parameter rm_host as
hue::server::rm_host in hiera.
Note that if hadoop::hadoop\_storage\_dirs is left unset, puppet will attempt to guess which
directories to use.

## Usage

- Make sure that the bigtop-deploy directory is available on every node of your cluster, and then
- Make sure you've installed puppet's stdlib "puppet module install puppetlabs/stdlib" version
  4.0.0 or newer.

And run the following on those nodes:

<pre>
# cp bigtop-deploy/puppet/hiera.yaml /etc/puppet
# mkdir -p /etc/puppet/hieradata
# rsync -a --delete bigtop-deploy/puppet/hieradata/bigtop/ /etc/puppet/hieradata/bigtop/
# cat > /etc/puppet/hieradata/site.yaml &lt;&lt; EOF
# bigtop::hadoop_head_node: "hadoopmaster.example.com"
# hadoop::hadoop_storage_dirs:
#   - "/data/1"
#   - "/data/2"
# bigtop::bigtop_yumrepo_uri: "http://mirror.example.com/path/to/mirror/"
# EOF
# puppet apply -d --modulepath="bigtop-deploy/puppet/modules:/etc/puppet/modules" bigtop-deploy/puppet/manifests/site.pp
</pre>
